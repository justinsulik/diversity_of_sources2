    <h3>Debriefing</h3>
    <p>The following is a brief description of the study, if you're interested in knowing.</p>
    <p>We often take note of others' opinions when making decisions, but rationally, it should matter whether those opinions are independent (gained from different sources) or dependent (grained from the same source). We varied the number of TV stations watched by the cartoon figures, and want to see how that affects your decisions.</p>
